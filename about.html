      JDE Solutions focuses on stabilization, simplification, and modernization planning for organizations operating in complex, often undocumented environments.

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
      We help teams regain control when systems have become fragile, manual, or risky.
      That typically includes infrastructure visibility, security posture reality checks, operational automation opportunities, and decision-ready modernization paths for legacy technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work is designed to be understandable to both technical staff and leadership, with deliverables that support action rather than debate.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>How we deliver efficiently</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on structured assessment frameworks and internal tooling to accelerate documentation, mapping, and prioritization.
      The goal is to shorten time-to-clarity and minimize disruption to your team.

      <strong>Boundary:</strong> Tools accelerate delivery. They are not the product. Outcomes are the product.
